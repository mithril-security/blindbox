## What is BlindBox?
________________________________________________________

**BlindBox** is a **privacy solution** that will allow developers **to deploy** Software-as-a-Service (**SaaS**) **applications** with **guarantees** that their users' will be **kept confidential at all times**. We use **secure enclaves**, **hardware based** and highly **isolated** environments, to protect data during computation. 

BlindBox is **COMING SOON.**

Key features:

+ A **CLI tool** for quick deployment of your **Docker images** within secure enclaves

+ Custom security features for additional layers of protection tailored to your client's needs

While we are working on these features, we have prepared a **demo LLM API** using BlindBox containing query Whisper and ChatGPT within a secure enclave. You can use this demo to explore how BlindBox can be used to protect your services.

> You can check out [the project code on our GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindbox/). 

We‚Äôll update the documentation as new features come in!
