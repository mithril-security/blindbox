## ⬛ What is BlindBox?
________________________________________________________

**BlindBox** is a **privacy solution** that will allow developers **to deploy** Software-as-a-Service (**SaaS**) **applications** with **guarantees** that their users' data will be **kept confidential at all times**. We use **secure enclaves**, **hardware based** and highly **isolated** environments, to protect data during computation. 

*BlindBox is* ***COMING SOON.***

🗝️ **Key features**:

+ A **CLI tool** for quick deployment of your **Docker images** within secure enclaves

+ Custom security features for additional layers of protection tailored to your client's needs

While we are working on these features, we have prepared a **demo LLM API** using BlindBox containing query Whisper and ChatGPT within a secure enclave. You can use this demo to explore how BlindBox can be used to protect your services.

> You can check out [the project code on our GitHub](https://github.com/mithril-security/blindbox/). 

We’ll update the documentation as new features come in!

## 📚 How is the documentation structured?
____________________________________________
<!--
- [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials/core/installation.md) take you by the hand to install and run BlindBox. We recommend you start with the **[Quick tour](./docs/getting-started/quick-tour.ipynb)** and then move on to the other tutorials!  
-->

- [Concepts](./docs/concepts/BlindAI_Core.md) guides discuss key topics and concepts at a high level. They provide useful background information and explanations, especially on cybersecurity.

<!--
- [How-to guides](./docs/how-to-guides/covid_net_confidential.ipynb) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how BlindBox works.

- [API Reference](https://blindai.mithrilsecurity.io/en/latest/blindai/client.html) contains technical references for BlindAI’s API machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume you have a good understanding of key concepts.

- [Security](./docs/security/remote_attestation/) guides contain technical information for security engineers. They explain the threat models and other cybersecurity topics required to audit BlindBox's security standards.
-->

- [Advanced](./docs/advanced/build-from-sources/client/) guides are destined to developers wanting to dive deep into BlindBox and eventually collaborate with us to the open-source code. 

- [Past Projects](./docs/past-projects/blindai) informs you of our past audited project BlindAI, of which BlindBox is the evolution. 

## 🔒 Who made BlindBox?

BlindBox was developed by **Mithril Security**. **Mithril Security** is a startup focused on AI privacy solutions based on **Confidential Computing** technology. We provide several **open-source tools** for **querying** and **deploying AI solutions** while **guaranteeing data privacy**.
