    "**BlindBox** protects SaaS users' data. It wraps applications in a sandbox with customizable access possibilities and deploys them on **Confidential VMs**, which provide **robust hardware based isolation and protection**. When clients connect to a BlindBox and query the application with their data, the service provider has no way of accessing or seeing this data - hence our name BlindBox! \n",
