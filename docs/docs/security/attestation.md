# Attestation with BlindBox: Advanced Guide

We provide a quick-fire description of what attestation is in our [confidential computing guide](https://blindbox.mithrilsecurity.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/confidential_computing/) , but the aim of this article is to cover attestation in more depth and discuss how it has been implemented with BlindBox.

We currently only support the deployment of BlindBoxes on AMD SEV-SNP confidential VMs with Azure, so this guide will focus on attestation for these machines. We will update this guide as and when new platforms are supported.

## Who is responsible for attestation?

The attestation process is an automated process managed by BlindBox. Attestation is set-up to be performed by default whenever an end user starts a new connection to a BlindBox- from a customer perspective, no additional actions are required. If any of our attestation checks fail, the end user will be unable to connect to the BlindBox.

The BlindBox attestation process makes use of the Microsoft Azure Attestation service and Microsoft client-side attestation application, which in turn requests and leverages a attestation report produced by AMD SEV-SNP.

## What do we attest?

+ The Microsoft Azure Attestation service attests the validity of the AMD SEV-SNP report by verifying the reports hardware-derived signature.
+ BlindBox attests checks that the JWT attestation token response we get back from the Microsoft Azure Attestation service has not been tampered with by verifying the token’s signature, validity and some runtime information.

BlindBox then uses the information provided in JWT attestation response to verify that:

+ Verify that we are communicating with a genuine AMD SEV-SNP confidential VM.
+ Verify that we are communicating with a genuine Azure-compliant VM.
+ Verify that the VM is running in production mode and not debug mode.

## The attestation workflow

Let’s walk through the whole life cycle of the attestation process from the moment an end user starts a new connection with a SaaS application deployed with BlindBox.

1. The end user queries the application. This triggers a new connection request, which in turn triggers the attestation process. 
2. BlindBox requests attestation using the Microsoft attestation library.
3. The Microsoft attestation library requests an attestation report from AMD SEV-SNP. This report is signed by a hardware-derived key. For more details about this report [here](#amd-sev-snp-attestation-report).
4. This report is then sent to the Microsoft Azure Attestation (MAA) Service.
5. MAA verifies the signature on this report, confirming that it was generated by genuine AMD SEV-SNP hardware. If this check is successful, MAA returns a signed JWT attestation token containing details about the SEV-SNP environment to the Microsoft attestation library. For more details about this report [here](#maa-attestation-token).
6. This token is then returned to BlindBox.
7. BlindBox verifies the validity of this token before using the report to perform the checks detailed above.
8. BlindBox returns an error if any of these checks are unsuccessful. If not, the end user will successfully connect to the BlindBox application and their query will be processed.

## Examples

Let's take a look at what happens if the attestation process is not successful.

For an interactive demo of the attestation process, check out our [Gradio demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mithril-security/BlindBox).

### Example 1: User queries BlindBox application running on a non-compliant Azure VM

Query:
```python
res = requests.post(url=f"http://{CONFIDENTIAL_VM_IP_ADDRESS}/generate", json={"input_text": "def print_hello_world():"})
```

Response:
```bash
$ __main__.NonCompliantUvm: Attestation validation failed (non-compliant uvm). Exiting.
```

### Example 2: User queries BlindBox application running in a confidential VM running in debug mode

Query:
```python
res = requests.post(url=f"http://{CONFIDENTIAL_VM_IP_ADDRESS}/generate", json={"input_text": "def print_hello_world():"})
```

Response:
```bash
$ __main__.DebugMode: Attestation validation failed (enclave is in debug mode). Exiting.
```

## Attestation reports

### AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Report

The AMD SEV-SNP attestation report contains information relating to the confidential environment our application is running within. For full details of all of the information provided in the report is provided in [AMD SEV-SNP’s technical documentation](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/56860.pdf)- see page 44 for an outline of all of the report’s fields.

The report is signed by a Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK), which is derived from chip- unique secrets and a TCB_VERSION. For more details, please refer to AMD’s technical documentation.

### MAA Attestation Token

The attestation token response generated by the Microsoft Azure Attestation (MAA) service is a signed JSON Web Token containing information related to the Azure VM our application is deployed on and the confidential environment our application is running within. The latter information is taken from the AMD SEV-SNP attestation report once its signature has been verified by the MAA service. The attestation token is signed with a self-signed certificate with subject name matching the AttestUri element of the attestation provider.

Here is an example of a MAA attestation token:
