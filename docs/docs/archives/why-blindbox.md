# Use Cases

## SaaS applications

Despite the explosion of **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications** over the last few years, **some organizations** still **cannot use them** because the **data** they deal with is **too sensitive** to risk **leakage**. 

This is why we have created BlindBox, so developers can **deploy their SaaS solutions** in highly-protected isolated environment. We ensure users' data is kept confidential by running services within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We aim to provide the same level of security, isolation and control as on-premise deployment.

### Example: Large Language Models (LLMs)

In the current gold rush towards **Large Language Models (LLMs)** applications, companies and institutions want to **trust** models like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot. But this has not been possible for actors juggling sensitive data, like the codebase of a software under development, a classified government report, a client database full of personal data... Because **no LLMs providers offer robust privacy guarantees**. 

This is where BlindBox comes in. Deploying a model using our privacy tools can facilitate and increase the adoption of LLMs, because users wouldn't have to worry about their data being exposed to the service provider.
