# Previous Projects: BlindAI

BlindBox is the evolution of our previous project [BlindAI](https://blindai.mithrilsecurity.io/en/latest/).

BlindAI is our open-source and audited privacy solution designed for the deployment and querying and of AI models.

Data sent by users to the models was protected by secure enclaves using Intel SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) ðŸ”’ technology.

BlindBox aims to develop on what we created with BlindAI, allowing users to deploy not just AI models but whole SaaS solutions, within secure enclaves!
