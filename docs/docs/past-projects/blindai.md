_________________________________________

BlindBox is the evolution of our previous project [BlindAI](https://blindai.mithrilsecurity.io/en/latest/).

BlindAI ðŸ”’ is our **open-source** and **audited privacy solution** designed for the **deployment** and **querying** of **AI models**. Data sent by users to the models is protected by secure enclaves using **Intel SGX** (Intel Software Guard Extensions) technology.

BlindBox â¬› aims to **improve on what we created with BlindAI**, allowing users to deploy not just AI models, but whole SaaS solutions within secure enclaves!
