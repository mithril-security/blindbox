## Build Instructions for Windows
 1. Create a Windows Confidential or Trusted Launch virtual machine in Azure and clone the sample application.
 2. Install Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed and running on your computer. If it's not installed yet, follow the steps in  [Install C++ support in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170).
 3. To build your project, choose **Build Solution** from the **Build** menu. The **Output** window shows the results of the build process.
 4. Once the build is successful, to run the application navigate to the `Release` build folder and run the `AttestationClientApp.exe` file.

## Build Instructions for Linux

Create a Linux Confidential or Trusted Launch virtual machine in Azure, clone the application and make sure the apt-get database is up to date (`sudo apt-get update`).

Use the below command to install the `build-essential` package. This package will install everything required for compiling our sample application written in C++.
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Install the below packages
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
$ sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev
```

Download the attestation package from the following location - https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azurecore/pool/main/a/azguestattestation1/

Use the below command to install the attestation package
```sh
$ sudo dpkg -i azguestattestation1_1.0.2_amd64.deb
```

Once the above packages have been installed, use the below steps to build and run the app

```sh
$ cd cvm-attestation-sample-app/
$ cmake .
$ make
$ sudo ./AttestationClient -o token
```
